# MyBase_InsertUser
Just a small demonstration of various ways to insert users to database using procedures.

At first I created a small database containing UserId, name, status.
After that i created one view, and two procedures:
 1. insertUser,
 2. insertUser2.

Later I added one more column, "password", and created new procedure InsertUser3 which adds new users if they do not exist. If any of them exists than updates new status and password.

Hope you like it :)...
